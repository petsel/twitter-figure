How open, conscientious, extraverted, agreeable and neurotic are celebrities?


##Consciousness

###What does that mean?
Consciousness is a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutifully, and aim for achievement against measures or outside expectations. It is related to the way in which people control, regulate, and direct their impulses. High scores on consciousness indicate a preference for planned rather than spontaneous behavior.

###What’s in the data?
Only 30 per cent of the world’s most famous people tend to be really conscious. It seems that creativity is valued much higher than duty and a serious attitude to life. David Bowie is among the few conscious ones: his score is 80 which means he’s among less than 10 per cent of celebrities with the same score or higher.


##Openness

###What does that mean?
Openness is a general appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience. People who are open to experience are intellectually curious, appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be more creative and more aware of their feelings.

###What’s in the data?
Surprise surprise: more than 70 percent of the world’s most powerful celebrities tend to be open to new experiences. Leonardo DiCaprio is an absolute special case: his openness ranking being high, other parameters like extraversion or consciousness are only mediocre.


##Extraversion

###What does that mean?
Extraversion is characterized by breadth of activities (as opposed to depth) and energy creation from external means. Extraverts enjoy interacting with people, and are often perceived as full of energy. They tend to be enthusiastic, action-oriented individuals. They possess high group visibility, like to talk, and assert themselves.

###What’s in the data?
More than a half of the analyzed celebrities tend to be extroverts, which is really not surprising taking into account their contacts to the outside world. Emma Watson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Yoko Ono are among stars who tend to be extremely extroverted. On the other hand, Gerard Butler and Kelly Osbourne are almost unearthly introverted – their rank is 2 and 0 respectively on the scale of 100.


##Agreeableness

###What does that mean?
Agreeableness reflects individual differences in general concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting and trustworthy, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others. They also have an optimistic view of human nature.

###What’s in the data?
It seems like only half of the celebrities tend to be agreeable – a factor that is extremely important for job promotion in the future and happy marriage. Zack Snyder, Adam Levin and Alicia Keys are the names you need to remember here – all of them rank high on this scale.


##Neuroticism

###What does that mean?
Neuroticism is something you don’t usually want to score high at. It is the tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression. It is sometimes called emotional instability. Those who score high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive and vulnerable to stress. They are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult.

###What’s in the data?
Most celebrities tend to be somewhere in the middle. However, Prince Bow and Claudia Jung seem to be a great exception – both of them are in the lower third of other rankings and are at the same time above the average in this category.



*From this point the mini application that was jointly developed within less than 18 hours by Natalia(@karbasa), Tim(@Tim_Dettmers), Aurelius(@webtobesocial), Michael Schlüter and Peter(@petsel) at the #hackathonHH (June 7th to 8th 2014, Hamburg - Germany) is waiting to be improved further in many different playful directions.*

*The Data presented by this app got processed in order to predict people's personalities, here by analyzing twitter stream content of celebrities. Tim, still studying mathematics, did provide all the math's foundation and the Python scripts for gathering data and doing the statistics.*

*Natalia is a data journalist and a digital media strategist. For the time hacking she was the quick thinking but also pragmatic mind that came up with the research, all non auto processed content, the final presentation and much more ideas than what in the end could be achieved as this hackathon's working result.*

*Michael is a physicist, a free lance and an experienced old days Perl developer. At this project he did provide empirical threshold values for the categories from the celebrities statistics and contributed as side project an image/chart generator that did visualize Tim's data for the final presentation.*

*The Frontend tasks have been solved by Aurelius(SVG punchcard charts / d3.js) and Peter. All data you get presented here is baked right into the application due to having had no time for the client server tasks. Both the JSON of the underlying mockup and all punchcard TSV data are direct results of Tim's Python skills.*

*Thanks to the organizers, sponsors, and the hacking crowd. This event was in many ways highly enjoyable.*
